Javascript Execution Context / CallStack

Global execution Context
Function execution  Context

let val1 = 10
let val2 = 15
function add(num1,num2){
    let total = num1 + num2;
    return total
}
let result1 = add(val1,val2);
let result2 = add(10,8)

1) Global execution -> this

2) Memory phase -> variables are allocatted Memory
val1 = undefined
val2 = undefined
add - defination
result1 = undefined
result2 = undefined

3) Execution phase
val1 = 10
val2 = 15
add - >  execution thred + new environment variables
    - > Memory 
     num1 = undefined
     num2 = undefined
     total = undefined
    - >execution 
     num1 = 10
     num2 = 15
     total = 25
     destory after execution is completed

Call stack - LIFO
